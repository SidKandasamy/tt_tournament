This is the technical project set on our final day at the DevelopMe Coding Fellowship with the deadline being on Sunday 29th September.

# Brief

The exercise is to create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament bracket from a list of names collected from the user.

It's up to you how you implement this, with JavaScript, React, or PHP, as a web page, or as an app.

Optional advanced features might include:

ability to record scores for each player, or mark which player won from each pairing, to create the next round of the tournament playoffs
continued rounds created until the final (last 2 players who have won all matches to date play each other, one marked as the winner)
